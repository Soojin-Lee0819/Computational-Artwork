# Assignment 3:Object Oriented Programming

## Title: Foodchain underwater

My favorite fish is Salmon but I came across the news article ever since then, I can not think about . I wanted to create a. I wanted to create a light-hearted interactive animation that mimics the food chain.

Following to the instructions for this assignment to in corporate object-oriented programming, I created two classes, "fish", and "salmon",, This includes location, shape, movement and interactivity of two ocean creatures. 

Salmon eats fish and when the mouse is clicked, new Salmon appears. 

This is demonstrated in the video below:

Users can not only create more Salmons but they can also catch Salmons by hovering mouse over the Salmon. 
I have demonstrated this when there is no fish left in the ocean in the video below:

## Process
I was exploring example Java to 



When it reaches maximum, it notify how that there is no more Salmon in the ocean


## Challenges

Although it turned out to be really convenient and in the beginning having multiple tabs was confusing. 

How to Erase Fish?

Draw Salmon
