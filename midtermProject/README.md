# Production Midterm: 'Tune-in Catcher' Processing Game

## DESCRIPTION
'**Tune-in Catcher**' is an audio-visual game that invites players to play with both image and sound. It is a game where players listen to music and catch falling objects that match the song that is being played, while avoiding bombs! For instance, if the song "Do you want to build a snowman" from the movie Frozen, is being played, among many other items that are falling from the sky, player have to catch the snowman icon. The aim of this game for th players is to complete catching all five songs without getting hit by the bomb. Playing this game, I hope players to have fun cathcing items as well as enjoy listening to some of my favorite songs! 

## IDEATION

It  companies me throughout the day, elevate my mood and brings a great deal of joy in my life. Therefore, through this music game, I wanted to share the joy I get from listening to music with others.

## Reflection & Evaluation 

Working on this project, the biggest challenge was

While previous projects were one dimensional, in a sense that there is one working page, this project is in layers where while one action is happening that will lead to another action and etcetera.
