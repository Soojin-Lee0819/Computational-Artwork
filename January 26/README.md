# Assignment 1:Processing Self Portrait 

## Project Description
This is a self-portrait drawn entirely by code using basic drawing functions in Processing. I used simple shapes and created a cartoon-like portrait of myself. Since this is my first project using Processing, the main focus was on understanding principles of coding and exploring features available on Processing. Since I mainly used simple shapes such as circle, ellipse, rectangle, and strokes, instead of focusing on making a realistic representation of myself, I tried to capture the character and personality of myself in the portrait. The scope of this project was to create a non-dynamic static image, as I code, I added some dynamic animation features like changing colors, moving eyebrows, and enlarging blush to make it more engaging for the viewers. 

Below is the image of my final self portrait:

and this is the animated version of my portrait:

## Process 

### *1. Brainstorm & Limitation on variety of shapes I can code*

After class, as I was so excited to try out things that I learnt in the class, I started to code directly on Processing Program. Since this was my first time drawing by code, it was not easy for me to visualize while coding. Therefore, although it seemed like an extrawork, I decided to sketch the outline first. On my ipad, I used simple shapes to sketch out the portrait of myself as shown below:

Based on this sketch, I started to code one shape at a time. When coding shapes, I depended greatly on https://processing.org/reference/ reference page to learn code languages, order of script and customized examples on the reference page to my project. 

I started with big structures of the body such as ellipse shape for face and rectangle shape for upper body then fill in with smaller elements like eyes, nose, and mouth. 

As I create shapes, I experimented with colors and assigned colors to the shapes in consideration of the harmony of the portrait as a whole piece. 

After inputting all the shapes, I added simple animations to some shapes. 

Finally I reciewed the codes and organized them making sure that they are indented properlly, and got rid of unnecessary comments or lines. 


## Challenges 

These are some of the challenges that I faced:

### *Positioning & Sizing*

Daniel shiffman's article https://processing.org/tutorials/drawing/ was very useful for me to have a basic understanding of coordinate system in Processing programme. However, positioning shapes in relative to other shapes at exact place were more challenging than expected. It was often a very tedious work of adding or subtracting numbers of x or y axis to find the exact place where I want it to be positioned at. 

### *Rotation*

When I was coding bangs, I encountered the challenge of rotation. It took me a while to learn how to rotate single shape. I used rotate(radians()) to rotate shape but as I run the program, I realized the entire shapes image were distorted. After a few trials and errors, I realized that I need to rotate it back to original position to prevent following shapes from rotating. 

Positioning and coordinating shape after rotation was complicated as well. I still don't understand fully on how positioning works after rotation. 

### *Customizing shape: Curves and organic shapes using Quadratic Vertex *

When drawing nose, I found out that it can't be drawn with a simple shape but it has to be manually put with 



Especially when drawing eyelashes, and sunshine shape, I had to use creative -- to make the tedious work less tedious. 

For eyelashes, I used the
