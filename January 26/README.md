# Assignment 1:Processing Self Portrait 

This project is a self-portrait drawn using basic drawing functions in Processing. 
Below is the image of my final self portrait:

## Project Description
This is a self-portrait drawn entirely by code. I used simple shapes and drawing functions in Processing to create an image of myself. Since this is my first project using Processing, the main focus was on understanding principles of coding and exploring features available on Processing. Since self-portrait is drawn using simple shapes such as circle, ellipse, rectangle and strokes, instead of focusing on making a realistic representation of myself, I tried to capture the character and personality of myself through the portrait. 

## Process & Challenges 

These are processes and some of the challenges that I faced:

### *Brainstorm & Limitation on variety of shapes I can code*
As I was excited to apply simple codings learnt in the class, my first instinct was to code directly on Processing. Soon I realized that brainstorming and sketching portrait composed of simple shapes before I start coding would be much easier. So I sketched self-portrait using simple shapes. 

Working on this project, I depended greatly on https://processing.org/reference/ reference page of Processing. I also had to improvise with given 

### *Positioning*

Daniel shiffman's article https://processing.org/tutorials/drawing/ was very useful for me to have a basic understanding of coordinate system and shapes in Processing programme. 

### *Rotation: Rotating single shape and positioning*

Understanding the concept of 
Since it was my first time codind using processing, I had to learn from the scratch on.

It took me a while to learn how to rotate single shape and 
When I first 
Furthermore, the understanding of the rotation position was much complicated. 

Since different shapes have different ways of , 

### *Customizing shape: Quadratic Vertex *

When drawing nose, I 

I still don't understand the function completely.



Positioning elements at the place where I envision it to be was a tedious process since I am not used to computer language. 
Especially when drawing eyelashes, and sunshine shape, I had to use creative -- to make the tedious work less tedious. 

For eyelashes, I used the
