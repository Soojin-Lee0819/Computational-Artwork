# Assignment 1:Processing Self Portrait 

## Project Description
This is a self-portrait drawn entirely by code using basic drawing functions in Processing. I used simple shapes to create a cartoon-like self-portrait. Since this is my first project using Processing, the main focus was on understanding the principles of coding. Since I mainly used simple shapes such as circle, ellipse, rectangle, and strokes, instead of making a realistic representation of myself, I focused on capturing the character and personality of myself in the portrait. The scope of this project was to create a non-dynamic static image. However, I added some dynamic animation features like changing colors, moving eyebrows, and enlarging blush to make it more engaging for the viewers. 

Below is the image of my final self portrait:

and this is the animated version of my portrait:

## Process 

### *1. Brainstorm & Limitation on variety of shapes I can code*

After class, I was so excited to try out things that I learnt in the class that I started to code directly on Processing Program. Since this was my first time drawing by code, it was not easy for me to visualize and translate to code simultaneously. Therefore, although it seemed like an extrawork, I decided to sketch the outline first. On my ipad, I used simple shapes to sketch out the portrait of myself as shown below:

Based on this sketch, I started to code one shape at a time. When coding shapes, I depended greatly on https://processing.org/reference/ reference page to learn code languages and customized examples on the reference page to my project. 

I started with big structures of the body such as ellipse shape for face and rectangle shape for upper body then fill in with smaller elements like eyes, nose, and mouth. 

As I create shapes, I experimented and carefully assigned colors to shapes. 

Originally, I did not plan to design background but I decided to create a background that supports representing the the personality of myslef, hence I added sunshine patterns. 

After inputting all the shapes and background patterns, I added simple animations such as changing colors, positions and sizes. 

Before I run the program, I reciewed codes to make sure that they are indented properlly, and got rid of the unnecessary comments or sentences. 

Finally, I used  saveFrame("line-######.png") function to save each frame and I used online GIF converter to export it as GIF file. 

## Challenges 

These are some of the challenges that I faced:

### *Positioning & Sizing*

Daniel shiffman's article https://processing.org/tutorials/drawing/ was very useful for me to have a basic understanding of coordinate system in Processing programme. However, positioning shapes in relative to other shapes were more challenging than expected. It was a very tedious for me to position shappes at exact place where I want it to be placed.


### *Rotation*

When I was coding bangs, I used the function rotate(radians()) to rotate semicircle shapes but as I run the program, all of the following shapes were rotated and distorted the entire image. After a few trials and errors, I realized that I need to rotate it back to original angle to prevent following shapes from rotating. 

Apart from this, ositioning and coordinating shape after rotation was also very complicated. I still don't understand fully on how positioning works after rotation. I woudl like to learn this in upcoming lesson.  

### *Customizing shape: Drawing Curves and organic shapes using Quadratic Vertex *

When drawing nose, I found out that it can't be drawn with a simple shapes such as cicle, rectangle or triangle but it has to be manually scripted with codes. Unlike simple shapes that has a format that I can follow, vertex were more difficult since I had to invision 


### *Color Choices*
Originally, I . Once I decide to design a background, coloring became an issue for me. In order to emphasize the bright yellow and orange sunshine patterns, the original washed pastel background did not emphasize the bright yellow/orange sunshine patterns. It was not easy choosing colors  Since the sunlight color

## Reflection/Evaluation

Overall, I enjoyed working on this project and I am very satified with the outcome. One thing that I would like to work on is to
