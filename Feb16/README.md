## Title: Special Five-Course Meal Reservation 

### Overall Concept:
This project generates a personalized five-course meal menu for the user whenever the code runs. In this program, user can make a reservation for a fine dining restaurant, and receive an invitation card with the list of five course meal menus that is determined randomly based on the different options listed in the table in the .csv file. The menu consists of five-courses that are: hours d'oeuvre, appetizer, salad, main, and dessert.   invitation  by writing down his/her name and type in the date on the landing page and click "make reservation". The name writtend down will be on the menu, that says "Welcome *NAME*" and . The dishes for the course meal are determined randlmly based on the different options listed in the table in the .csv file. This csv file is created by me.

### Description & 

When the program runs, users land on the mainpage that introduces Chef Soojin and her restaurant "Soojin Lee Kitchen". I created an arbitrary restaurant for this projecet using my name, imagining I am a star chef. This page consists of three elements. An image of the elegent dish on top, word description of the restaurant in the middle, and a section where users type in their name and the date of reservation to make a reservation. 

Image of the landing page is attached below:

The welcome card includes these:
- The name of the person who made a reservation ("Welcome **name**)
- The date (Feb/**date**/2021)
- The list of five-course dishes randomly chosen from the table in the csv file.
