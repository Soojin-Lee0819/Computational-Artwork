For this weeek, I was instructed to  made a birthday song and more to celebrate birthday using Auduino. 

## Schematic

The schematic for this project is below:

### Tips on Schematic

- I tried to balance out left and right side of the schematic. Since I use a lot of LEDlight (output) for this project, I put photoresistor, which can be positioned either side on the left. 

- I labelled inputs/outputs with red to make it easier for you to read the schematic

- I filled in the hole for the closed circuit that are and just  circle for a switch that is not closed.

## Challenges & Process Explanation 

### Build circuit with 9 lights, 1 button, 1 photoresisotr, 1 servo motor

Since each LED light required a cramped. I had to adjust the shape and 

### Assigning Pins to Appropriate Number

Since I use both 

### Destroyed Piezzo Buzzer Leg

You can't build it when you destroy your device! But you can be creative! 

I broke the leg of the lesson learnt here is that I will need to be more careful with the equipments. I tried to fix it by using bluetag to hold the leg but it was not very stable. 

Meanwhile, I started to build heart shape 

I got my piezo buzzer replaced by professor Michael Shiloh.
