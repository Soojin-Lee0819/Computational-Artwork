# Final Project Journal

### Preliminary concept for my final project 

I love cafe. I do love drinking coffee, eating sweets but apart from that, I love cafe for its vibe, the atmosphere, the people, the smell, and the aesthetics and the experience I get all-together. One of my wish list is to own a coffee shop. Why not own a cafe now? So for my final project, using Arduino and Processing, I will design a Soojin cafe and make my dream come true.

This will be a cafe-barista game where you will need to complete certain tasks, challenges in order to win this game. Due to the nature of this game, it won't be a "competitive" game, but more like a relaxing game where you follow the instructions to enjoy completing certain tasks and enjoy while playing it. 

I plan incorporate different execises that I have done so far throughout the semester to come up with interesting tasks and performances that players have to take. 

For now, considering the scope of this project, I envision this game to involve 4-5 different challenges/tasks. Each task will involve some sort of communication between arduino and processing and I plan to make it very creative and engaging.

Here are some of the challenges that I have in mind as of now.

## Task Ideas

### Setting up light 

Setting a cozy, welcoming and comfortable environment for cafe is a key. I plan to use potentiometer, LED light pins and that allow players to adjust the lighting of the cafe.
