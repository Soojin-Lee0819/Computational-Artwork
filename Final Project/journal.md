### Preliminary concept for my final project 

I love cafe. I do love drinking coffee and eating delicious cakes from the cafe but apart from that, I also going to cafe for its vibe, the atmosphere, the people, the smell, the aesthetics and the experience I get all-together. One of my bucket list is to own a coffee shop. So for my final project, using Arduino and Processing, I want to produce a fun and relaxing cafe game and make my dream come true albiet virtually.

This is not a competitive game. It will be a fun and relaxing game where you follow the instructions to enjoy completing certain tasks and enjoy while playing it.  

For now, considering the scope of this project, I plan to have 4-5 different challenges/tasks. Each task will involve the use of arduino and processing and I plan to make it very creative and engaging.

Here are some of the challenges that I have in mind as of now.

## Task Ideas

### Setting up light 

Setting a cozy, welcoming, and comfortable environment for cafe is a key. Players will be given an image of the lighting of the cafe with some clues. Then it is their task to find a way to adjust the lighting of the cafe and set up a light in a way that matches the image. Photoresistor and LED lights will be needed for this challenge.

### Set a Cafe Music

Another importnat aspect a cafe is its "music" choice. For this section, players can use potentiometer to choose the background music of the cafe.

### Getting Order

I plan to add a pin to the servo motor and make a spinning wheel with a list of request from the customers for the latte art. Servo motor will spin and whatever it stops on will be the task for the next challenge.

### Latte Art

Based on the sketch design (order) that was chosen by previous challenge, you need to draw a latte art. You will use keyboard and buttons for this challenge.

### Motor
I want to incorporate motor for my final project but as of now I didn't learn how to use motor. After learning how to use motor on Thursday, if applicable, I may add one more challenge that incorporates motor.
