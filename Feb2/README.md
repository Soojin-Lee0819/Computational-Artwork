# Assignment 2:Processing Computer Graphic Artwork 

## Title: Pattern in Nature  


For week 2, I created a computer graphic artwork using loops (for() or while()). In nutshell, structured in three parts - *init, test, and update* - loops operates *init* and continues until the test evaluates to false. Since it is a sequence of repetition, when a loop is executed, it creates a pattern. Using this loops function, and incorporating if() syntax, I made an artistic representation of a tree with colorful leaves and aesthetically designed branch.

The idea stemmed from myself wanting to capture the beauty of nature in the graphic world. I always thought patterns in the nature and visible regulairties of form found in the natural world extremely fascinating. Therefore, since the scope of this project is about incorporating *loops* function that creates pattern, I wanted to model the beauty of nature in graphic design. It was especially interesting to work on this project because we often consider computer graphic work as an antonym of natural world. However this project shows how they are not necessarily a black or white binary concept but instead, it proves how everything is interrelated and how every man-made object stems from the natural principle.

## Process & Challenges

### 1. Sketch tree using simple shapes

### 2. Trunk and Branches (Fractal Tree)

I originally planned to separate trunk from branches. So I started with drawing triangle shape for the trunk. However, to manually position branches on the trunk was a tedious process. Having learnt for() and while() syntax in class, I decided to use loops as a solution to this challenge. Referencing the example from the website https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Fractal_tree#Processing, I applid fractal tree principle to draw branch with a beautifully symmetrical pattern. 

### 3. Leaves Pattern

It was challenging for me to learn how to use loops (while() or for()) that applies for both x and y axies. When  It took me a lot of time to learn how to continuously run for () { for x axies and y axies. Instead of filling. it was making a diagonal line, when what I wanted to continuously draw both rows and . 
Creating leaves were the biggest challenge for me. Using 



### 4. Rotation & Organize layering order

One issue was layering. I reordered 

Color: Using I was able to 

### 4. Masking

## Evaluation & Reflection 

Although it seemed simple on the surface, I have faced so many challenges working on this project hence I had to adjust the scope of project. Originally, I wanted to create and using if(mouseclick); function, and using translate(x,y), I planned to animate the leaves falling and instaed animate snow falling. However, since I have not learnt how to animate and due to the scope of this project, I created static image of tree with colorful leaves. In future, I would like to learn how to animate on processing, come back to this project and animation to this artwork.
