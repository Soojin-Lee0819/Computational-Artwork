# Assignment 2:Processing Computer Graphic Artwork 

## Title: Pattern in Nature 


For week 2, I created a computer graphic artwork that uses loops (for() or while()) feature. In nutshell, loops controls a sequence of repitions. It is structured in three parts: init, test and update. The loop continues until the test evaluates to false. Therefore, when a structure is executed, it creates a pattern with variables. Experimenting with loops, and incorporating if() syntax, I made an artistic representation of a tree with colorful leaves and aesthetically designed branch. Since I always thought patterns in the nature and visible regulairties of form found in the natural world extremely fascinating, I wanted to model the beauty of nature through this computer graphic art project. This is an interesting concept because we often consider computer processed work as an antonym of natural world but this project break the binary understanding of artificial world and natural world and merge them into one. 

**Below is the final image of my Computer Graphic Art:**

## Process & Challenges

### 1. Sketch tree using simple shapes

### 2. Trunk and Branches (Fractal Tree)

I originally planned to separate trunk with branches that I started with drawing triangle shape for the trunk. However, to manually position branches individually on the trunk seemed to be a tedious process, and having learnt for() and while() syntax in previous lesson, I saw the potential of loops that can provide a solution to this tedious process. Referencing, the example from the website https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Fractal_tree#Processing, I applide fractal tree principle to draw tree branches that split and created beautifully symmetrical branch pattern. 

Apart from using loops(for()) feature, I also incorporated if() statement, that decides whether the branch should split or not. 

### 3. Leaves Pattern

During classs, since we only it was difficult for me to learn how to use for() that applies for both. It took me a lot of time to learn how to continuously run for () { for x axies and y axies. It was making a diagonal line, when what I wanted to continuously draw both rows and . 
Creating leaves were the biggest challenge for me. Using 

One issue was layering. I reordered

## Evaluation & Reflection 

Although it seemed simple on the surface, I have faced so many challenges working on this project hence I had to adjust the scope of project. Originally, I wanted to create and using if(mouseclick); function, and using translate(x,y), I planned to animate the leaves falling and instaed animate snow falling. However, since I have not learnt how to animate and due to the scope of this project, I created static image of tree with colorful leaves. In future, I would like to learn how to animate on processing, come back to this project and animation to this artwork.
