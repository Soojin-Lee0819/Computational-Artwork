# Assignment 2:Processing Computer Graphic Artwork 

## Title: Tree


For week 2, I created a computer graphic artwork that uses loops (for() or while()) feature. In nutshell, loops controls a sequence of repitions. It is structured in three parts: init, test and update. The loop continues until the test evaluates to false. Therefore, when a structure is executed, it creates a pattern with variables. Experimenting with loops, and incorporating if() syntax, I made an artistic representation of a tree with colorful leaves and aesthetically designed branch. Since I always thought patterns in the nature and visible regulairties of form found in the natural world extremely fascinating, I wanted to model the beauty of nature through this computer graphic art project. This is an interesting concept because we often consider computer processed work as an antonym of natural world but this project break the binary understanding of artificial world and natural world and merge them into one. 

Below is the final image of my Computer Graphic Art:

## Process & Challenges

### 1. Sketch tree using simple shapes

### 2. Originally, I wanted to represnet trunk of the tree with triangular shape with a round edge.
