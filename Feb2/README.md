# Assignment 2:Processing Computer Graphic Artwork 

## Title: Pattern in Nature 


For week 2, I created a computer graphic artwork that uses loops (for() or while()). In nutshell, structured in three parts: init, test and update, it controls a sequence of repitions. The loop continues until the test evaluates to false. Therefore, when a loop is executed, it creates a pattern with variables. Experimenting with loops, and incorporating if() syntax, I made an artistic representation of a tree with colorful leaves and aesthetically designed branch. I chose to represent tree since, I always thought patterns in the nature and visible regulairties of form found in the natural world extremely fascinating. Through this project, I wanted to model this beauty of nature through coding. This is an interesting concept because we often consider computer processed work as an antonym of natural world but this project shows how they are not necessarily a black or white binary concept but

## Process & Challenges

### 1. Sketch tree using simple shapes

### 2. Trunk and Branches (Fractal Tree)

I originally planned to separate trunk with branches. So I started with drawing triangle shape for the trunk. However, to manually position branches on the trunk was a tedious process. Having learnt for() and while() syntax in class, I saw the potential of using loops as a solution to this tedious process. Referencing the fractal tree example from the website https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Fractal_tree#Processing, I applide fractal tree principle to draw a beautifully symmetrical branch pattern. 

### 3. Leaves Pattern

Although it was difficult for me to learn how to use for() that applies for both. It took me a lot of time to learn how to continuously run for () { for x axies and y axies. It was making a diagonal line, when what I wanted to continuously draw both rows and . 
Creating leaves were the biggest challenge for me. Using 

One issue was layering. I reordered

## Evaluation & Reflection 

Although it seemed simple on the surface, I have faced so many challenges working on this project hence I had to adjust the scope of project. Originally, I wanted to create and using if(mouseclick); function, and using translate(x,y), I planned to animate the leaves falling and instaed animate snow falling. However, since I have not learnt how to animate and due to the scope of this project, I created static image of tree with colorful leaves. In future, I would like to learn how to animate on processing, come back to this project and animation to this artwork.
