# Arduino-Processing Assignment: Draw Korean Flag (Tae-Guk-key) !

## Description
Fort his week, I was instructed to make a simple game that involves some kind of communication between Arduino and Processing. Following this instruction, I created a drawing game that you use Arduino to control the brush/color of the paint and use a mouse to digitally draw the Korean flag. When Processing starts to run, you will see a landing page with an instruction. 

1. To start this game, dial the potentiometer to the right. 
2. Once the game start, you will receive the Korean flag sketch and the Korean Anthem will start to play.
3. Press the button on the Arduino to pick the colors and press mouse to start coloring the Korean flag.
